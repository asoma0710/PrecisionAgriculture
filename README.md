[![Drone Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kY86-xJx1SY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kY86-xJx1SY)

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **custom-built drone** designed for **precision agriculture**, focusing on:

- **Automated weed detection** using AI models  
- **Targeted herbicide spraying** to reduce chemical usage  
- **Field mapping and surveillance**

The drone is equipped with:
- Onboard cameras  
- Jetson Nano for real-time inference  
- Sprayer pump controlled via a microcontroller  
- GPS + LiDAR for accurate positioning  


## ðŸ”¬ Research Background

This project is part of my **Precision Agriculture** research at Midwestern State University. The goal is to **minimize herbicide usage** and **boost yield efficiency** through automated detection and response systems using AI and embedded systems.

## ðŸ“¦ Code Access

> ðŸ›‘ **Note**: The full codebase (AI model training, drone control logic, and embedded system integrations) will be published *after approval* from my colleagues and university. This repository will be updated accordingly.

## ðŸ“š Paper Publication

A research paper detailing the methodology, experiments, and outcomes is currently under peer review and will be linked here once officially published.
